# Routing

ZPR nodes do not run a routing protocol. There is no OSPF, no BGP, no
adjacency discovery, no route advertisement. The topology of a ZPRnet is
**declared in the configuration description** (the `.zplc` file), compiled into
the policy binary, and handed to the visa service. The visa service is the only
component that computes paths, and it computes them **per visa, at issuance**:
the chosen route is frozen into the visa as a next hop.

A node therefore learns exactly one routing fact, and only for flows it is
authorized to carry: "for this visa, hand the packets to that neighbour."

Read this before changing the topology schema, the `Router`/`TopologyMgr` pair,
or how a visa's next hop is chosen — and before adding a second node to a test
setup.

## The model

Three distinct things get called "routing" in ZPR. Keep them apart:

| | Where it lives | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Intended topology** | policy (from `.zplc`) | Every link an administrator has declared, with its attributes and cost. Static until a new policy is installed. |
| **Actual topology** | `Router`'s in-memory graph, persisted edges | The subset of declared links believed to be up right now. |
| **A route** | one visa | An ordered list of link IDs from the ingress node to the egress node, plus its total cost. |

*"Note that this is topology as it exists. For topology as it is intended to
be, you need to look at policy."* — `topology_mgr.rs`

A route is **not** a routing-table entry. It is a decision made once, for one
flow, and distributed as a next hop stamped into each node's copy of that
flow's visa. Nothing recomputes it in the data plane. If the topology changes,
the affected visas are revoked and the flow re-requests.

Flow setup is unidirectional, so each direction of a conversation gets its own
route, computed from its own ingress node. They need not be symmetric.

## Declaring topology in `.zplc`

```toml
[nodes.n0]
provider = [["device.zpr.adapter.cn", "node0.zpr.org"]]
zpr_address = "fd5a:5052:90de::1"

[nodes.n0.substrate_addrs]
i0 = "10.0.0.1:5000"

[nodes.n1]
provider = [["device.zpr.adapter.cn", "node1.zpr.org"]]
zpr_address = "fd5a:5052:90de::2"

[nodes.n1.substrate_addrs]
i0 = "10.0.0.2:5000"

[links.n0n1]
attributes = [["zpr.cost", "10"], ["#secure", ""], ["location", "usa"]]
peers = [{ node = "n0" }, { node = "n1", interface = "i0" }]
```

- **`provider`** is the attribute set an adapter must present to be recognized
  as that node. It cannot come from a trusted service — in practice it is
  `device.zpr.adapter.cn`, the CN of the node's Noise certificate.
- **`zpr_address`** identifies the node everywhere else in the system: it is the
  `NodeId`, the routing destination, and the key of every topology lookup. The
  node itself must be configured with the same address in its own `ph` config —
  nothing reconciles a mismatch.
- **`substrate_addrs`** are named interfaces (`i0`) in `HOST:PORT` form. `HOST`
  may be a hostname; the visa service resolves it via DNS when it loads the
  policy (`PolicyResolver::resolve_topology`). Multiple per node are supported
  in the schema; `peers` selects one with `interface = "i3"`. The `interface`
  key may be omitted only when the node has exactly one substrate address —
  with several it is a compile error, not a default.
- **`links.<LINKID>`** is one bidirectional edge with exactly two `peers`. The
  `<LINKID>` is a free-form string and travels all the way to the node in the
  `setTopology` message.
- **`attributes`** are key/value pairs, or **tags** written `["#name", ""]`.
  Giving a `#`-prefixed key a value is an error.

Link attributes land in the `link` attribute domain, so `zpr.cost` in the file
becomes **`link.zpr.cost`** in the compiled policy. **Every link gets a cost**:
if none is declared the compiler appends `zpr.cost = 1`, and
`DEFAULT_LINK_COST = 1` in `libeval` covers a link whose policy carries no cost
attribute. Costs are `u32` and simply summed along a path.

`README_ZPLC.md` §Nodes opens with "Only one node is supported currently in a
ZPRnet" and then documents multi-node topology below. Read it as a statement
about the data plane: the compiler and visa service both handle many nodes (see
§Implementation status). Relatedly, the undocumented `[visa_service]` section —
whose only key is `dock_node` — may be omitted, and the compiler fills it in on
the assumption there is one node (`zpr-compiler` issue 100).

`README_ZPLC.md` states that only `device`, `user`, and `service` namespaces are
valid for attributes. That rule is about actor attributes; link attributes are
namespaced `link` by the compiler and are never resolved against a trusted
service — they are topology data, not vouched-for claims.

### `over` clauses are checked here

Because ZPL and ZPLC are compiled together, the compiler can check an `over`
clause against the declared links:

- naming a link **attribute** no configured link carries is an **error** — the
  statement could never match;
- naming a **value** no configured link carries, when the attribute does exist,
  is a **warning** (fatal with `--werror`) — topology data may legitimately
  gain that value later.

This is the only place link constraints are enforced today. See
[§Route constraints](#route-constraints-in-policy).

## From `.zplc` to the visa service

```text
.zplc  --[compiler]-->  policy.capnp        --[libeval]-->  visa service
[links.X]              topology: [Peering]                  peer_table
  peers                  linkId, nodeA/B (ZPR addrs)        link_attrs
  attributes             nodeASubstrate/nodeBSubstrate      resolved_peers (DNS)
                         attrs                              Router graph
```

The compiler builds a `FabricLink` per `[links.*]` entry (`weaver::add_topology`)
resolving each `(node, interface)` pair to a `NodeLinkAddr { zpr_addr,
substrate }`, and emits it as a `Peering` in `Policy.topology`.

`libeval::policy` turns those peerings into two lookups:

- **`peer_table`**: node ZPR address → `Vec<Peer>`, each `Peer` holding the link
  id, the remote node's ZPR address, the remote substrate address, and *this*
  node's own substrate address on that link. One peering produces an entry under
  both endpoints, each oriented from that endpoint's point of view.
- **`link_attrs`**: link id → attributes.

`Policy::describe_link(node_a, node_b)` combines them into the
`LinkDescription { link_id, attrs, cost }` that the router installs.

A `PolicySnapshot` additionally caches `resolved_peers_by_node`: the same peer
list with hostnames already resolved to `SocketAddr`. Resolution happens once,
at policy load — a failing lookup fails the whole policy install, and DNS
changes are not picked up until the next install.

---

## The live graph

`TopologyMgr` owns the in-memory `Router` graph and a `LinkRepo` that persists
node-link adjacency so the graph survives a restart. Nodes themselves are
persisted by `ActorMgr`/`NodeRepo`; only edges are persisted here.

A link becomes live when **both** of its endpoints are connected nodes:

1. A node authenticates over VSAPI (`connect`/`open`) and is added to the graph
   as a bare vertex (`add_node_if_not_exists`).
2. `install_policy_links_for_node` walks the peerings policy declares for that
   node and, for each peer already in the connected-node list, calls
   `add_linked_node` — which installs the edge in the router from the policy's
   `LinkDescription` and write-throughs the adjacency to state. Peers not yet
   connected are logged and deferred until they connect and run the same code.
3. On restart, `restore_from_state` rebuilds from persisted edges; on every
   policy install, `revalidate_against_policy` reconciles the union of persisted
   and live edges against the new policy — refreshing id/attrs/cost, garbage-
   collecting links policy no longer declares, repairing router/persistence
   drift, and reporting orphaned nodes.

Three caveats, all documented in the code as TODOs:

- **A declared peering between two connected nodes is taken as evidence the link
  is up.** The visa service cannot see which peer forwarded a node's VSAPI
  connection, so a node with several connected peers gets edges for all of them.
  The suggested fix is to have the node report the link it came in over as a
  connect parameter.
- **A failed `add_linked_node` is logged, not retried.** It leaves the edge in
  neither the router nor state, and `revalidate_against_policy` only works the
  union of those two — so the link stays missing until an endpoint reconnects.
  Meanwhile the node *is* still told the link exists (topology messages come
  from policy, not the router), so its visa requests over that link deny
  `NoRoute` with nothing node-side to explain why.
  (`zpr-visaservice` issue 302.)
- **Multi-homed nodes are not supported** by `substrate_addr_from_topology`,
  which takes a node's own substrate address from the first resolved link it
  finds.

---

## Path computation

`Router` wraps a `Graph` of `nodes: NodeId -> {edges}` and
`edges: LinkId -> {a, b, attributes, cost}` behind one `RwLock`. Two queries:

**`get_best_route(a, b)`** — lowest total cost, ties broken arbitrarily. Served
from `Graph::best_routes`, an **all-pairs table recomputed by running Dijkstra
from every node** on each topology mutation. `a == b` short-circuits to a
`DirectSameNode` route: both actors dock on the same node, no link is traversed,
cost 0, and there is nothing to forward.

**`get_routes(a, b, hint)`** — *every* simple path, via an explicit-stack DFS
(no recursion limit), for the not-yet-implemented route-constraint evaluator.
This is the expensive one and it carries the interesting machinery:

- Results are memoized on `(src, dst, hint)`. Cache hits *and* DFS on a miss
  both run under a **read** lock, so lookups parallelize; only the insert takes
  the write lock.
- `topo_generation` is bumped on every mutation. If it changed while the DFS
  ran, the result may be stale: the call recomputes under the write lock and
  skips caching.
- `link_to_cache_keys` reverse-indexes which cached routes traverse each link,
  so **link removal** evicts exactly the affected entries. **Link addition**
  cannot use that index — a new edge can invalidate an entry whose routes never
  touched either endpoint — so `add_link` flushes the whole cache. The code
  documents the tighter bounds (topological horizon; and, for shortest-path
  caches only, the cost horizon of incremental SSSP) and defers them until
  profiling justifies the work.

`route_to_path(route, starting_node)` converts a link list into the ordered node
list, using the starting node to fix the direction.

---

## From route to visa

`visa_policy::evaluate_against_policy` is the single funnel — both the visa
request path and the policy-change re-check go through it, so a re-check applies
exactly the rules of the original decision.

1. Resolve each actor's **docking node**: the node its traffic enters the fabric
   at, from the connection table, falling back to the AAA table for fabricated
   anonymous actors. An undocked endpoint denies `SourceNotFound` /
   `DestNotFound`.
2. `get_best_route(docking_node_src, docking_node_dst)`. **No route at all
   denies `NoRoute`** before policy is even evaluated.
3. Evaluate policy. `AllowWithoutRoute` uses the best route as the default.
   `NeedsRoute` would enumerate candidate routes and evaluate each — see below.
4. `route_for_allow` takes the first hit's own route if it has one, else the
   default.

`path_for_flow` then orients the route into a **node path in flow order**:
ingress node first, egress last. It is anchored on the docking node of the
*source of the packets this visa authorizes*, deliberately **not** on the node
that asked for the visa — those coincide for an ordinary request but not for
visas the visa service mints pre-emptively on another node's behalf, and getting
the anchor wrong hands the destination node a next hop pointing back the way the
packets came. A `DirectSameNode` route yields no path.

`actualize_visa_for_target_node` then adapts one stored visa per node, reading
each node's role straight off its position in that path:

| Role | Position | What it gets |
|---|---|---|
| **Ingress** | first | Full visa (dock PEP, session keys) **plus** `FwdPep { next_hop }` |
| **Intermediary** | middle | `forwardOnly` visa: id and `FwdPep` only |
| **Egress** | last | Full visa, no `FwdPep` — the flow terminates here |

`FwdPep.next_hop` is the **next node's ZPR address**, not a link id and not an
interface. `FwdPep.symmetric` exists in the schema; the code always sets
`OneWay` with a `TODO: Not sure when to set this to symmetric`.

On policy install, `visa_reconciler` re-checks each live visa via
`recheck_visa_allowed`: denied → revoke; still allowed but the newly derived
path differs from the stored one → **revoke**. Routes are never edited in place.

---

## What the node does with it

Two halves, and only one of them is wired up.

**Visas — implemented.** `visa_mgmt::insert_visa` takes `fwd_pep.next_hop` (or
the dock PEP's destination address when there is no `FwdPep`), resolves it to a
link with `Assembly::find_egress_link` — which matches the address against the
node's own ZPR addresses first, then against each peer's registered actor
addresses — and stores it in the visa table. A next hop that resolves to no link
is rejected as `DestNotFound`. From there forwarding is pure Stream ID switching
(see [ZDP.md](ZDP.md)); the next hop is consulted once, at visa install, not per
packet.

**`setTopology` — a stub.** `vss_worker::process_topology` logs each link and
returns `Ok`:

```rust
fn process_topology(_asm: &Arc<Assembly>, links: Vec<Link>) -> SetTopologyResponse {
    info!(target: VSS_RPC, "received topology update with {} links (not yet implemented)", links.len());
    ...
}
```

So a node is told its peers, their substrate addresses, their ZPR addresses, and
carries bootstrap visas for them — and does nothing with any of it. No
node-to-node link is ever brought up: `LinkType::NodeToNode` is marked
*currently unsupported* in `link_state.rs`, and `insert_visa` outright panics on
a `forwardOnly` visa (`"Forward only visas not yet supported"`).

The consequence is worth stating plainly: **the control plane computes
multi-hop routes that the data plane cannot yet use.** Everything above —
Dijkstra, all-paths DFS, path orientation, per-role visa actualization — is
built, tested, and exercised by unit tests, while `zpr-core`'s integration
tests are `one-node-test.sh` and `one-node-v6-test.sh`. `zpr-demo/multinode-demo`
is the two-node deployment being built out against this gap.

---

## Route constraints in policy

ZPL's `over` clause constrains which links a flow may traverse:

```zpl
allow redhead users to access database over secure, location:usa links.
never allow baldy users to access database over foreign links.
```

The full pipeline exists in outline and is disconnected at every runtime joint:

| Stage | State |
|---|---|
| Compiler parses `over`, checks satisfiability against declared links | **works** |
| Compiler emits `CPolicy.linkConds` into the policy binary | **works** |
| `libeval` reads `linkConds` | **never read** — no reference to the field anywhere in `zpr-visaservice` |
| `RoutePredicate` (`DirectOnly`, `RequireLinkedPath`, `AnyLinkHas`, `NoLinkHas`, `AllLinksHave`, `And`, `Or`) | defined, never constructed |
| `PartialEvalResult::NeedsRoute` | defined, never returned — evaluation always yields `AllowWithoutRoute` or `Deny` |
| `RouteResidualEvaluator::eval_route` / `eval_routes` | `Err(InternalError("route evaluation not implemented"))`, with the intended algorithm written out in comments |
| `RouteHint`-based pruning in `Router::compute_routes` | hint accepted and ignored |
| `TopologyQueryApi::link_has_attr` on `TopologyMgr` | `return false` |

**An `over` clause compiles, is checked against the topology, and is then not
enforced.** A policy relying on one for security is not getting it. The
`link.zpr.cost` attribute is the sole exception: it is read, by
`describe_link`, as a number.

The design intent (`eval_route`'s comments): evaluate each candidate deny hit's
`RoutePredicate` against the route and re-check the actor conditions from the
cached actors; if any deny fires it is a deny; otherwise collect passing allow
hits. The two-phase split exists because the answer depends on which
permission matched —

```zpl
allow admins to access services over secure links.
allow employees to access services.          # implied: over any link
never allow admins to access services over insecure links.
```

— so evaluating a route requires knowing whether the actor matched as an admin
or merely as an employee.

---

## Bootstrap routing

A node that is not yet connected cannot be evaluated by policy — it has no
actor, and no route until its link is up — but it needs to reach the visa
service's VSAPI port to connect at all. `visa_bootstrap` resolves the circularity:

- Every `setTopology` message mints, per link, **two** visas for the *peer* (not
  the recipient): one for the peer's own SYN to VSAPI, one for the visa
  service's reply. Both are needed — with only the forward visa the reply is
  dropped, since no dock PEP matches it and no node on the forward path has a
  route back.
- The recipient holds them and hands them off when the peer shows up. The peer's
  own link is not in the router yet, so its first hop is stitched on from the
  peering rather than routed.
- Minting deliberately bypasses policy evaluation: **a peering declared in
  policy is itself the authorization** for that peer to reach VSAPI.
- An already-connected peer yields no bootstrap visas — it has a VSAPI session
  and asks for what it needs.

The whole module is labelled a HACK to get initial multi-node working
(`zpr-visaservice` issue 301) and is meant to be deleted.

---

## Addressing

Routing destinations are ZPR addresses, and where each kind comes from matters:

| | Source |
|---|---|
| **Node ZPR address** | `zpr_address` in `.zplc`, and the same value in the node's own config. Not allocated. |
| **Adapter/actor address** | Allocated by the visa service from its pool, or requested by the adapter via the `zpr.addr` claim (the one `zpr.*` claim an adapter may send). |
| **AAA address** | Used only during authentication. The ZPRnet AAA network is `fd5a:5052:0:aaa::/64`; each node gets a **/88** carved out using the low 24 bits of its node address, pushed to the node as the `AAA_PREFIX` configuration parameter and used to seed its local `AddressPool`. |
| **Static service address** | A service needing a fixed address sets `zpr_addr` in the adapter config *and* a matching `["zpr.addr", "..."]` provider attribute in `.zplc`. |

ZRFC 6.4 §4.1 has node addresses as prefixes from which dock and tether
addresses are cut, so a route to a dock covers every tether on it. The
implementation does not do this: `NodeId` is a flat `IpAddr`, routes are
computed strictly between node addresses, and the docking node for an actor
comes from a table lookup rather than from prefix containment.

---

## Observability

- **`GET /admin/network`** returns every link the current policy declares
  between nodes, deduplicated by normalized node pair, each carrying
  `node_a_addr`/`node_b_addr`, both substrate addresses, `link_id`,
  `link_attrs`, and `link_cost` from the policy's link description — plus a
  `ctype`: `UP` if a connected node reports the link, `DOWN` if policy declares
  it but no node reports it, `INVALID` otherwise (and then with no substrate
  addresses, link id, or cost).
- The per-node admin endpoint lists that node's `adapters` and `links`.
- `zpr-dashboard` (TUI) and `vs-admin gui` render the same data;
  `demo-zpr-dashboard` in the multinode demo wraps it.
- Deny reason **`NoRoute`** in the deny log is the routing-specific failure:
  either an endpoint is undocked or no path exists between the two docking
  nodes.
- Counter `LinkInstallFailed` counts the silent-link-loss case described above.

---

## Implementation status

Specified or designed, not working:

- **Node-side topology.** `setTopology` is a log-only stub; no node-to-node link
  is established.
- **`forwardOnly` visas** panic on install, so a path with an intermediary node
  cannot work. Two nodes with one link between them need only ingress and egress
  visas, which is why that is the frontier.
- **Route constraints** (`over`) are compiled and never enforced.
- **Next-hop selection modes** from ZRFC 6.4 §5.11.2 — a visa specifying an
  exact next hop, or a constrained set of permissible next hops, versus leaving
  the choice to the forwarder. The implementation always computes the whole path
  centrally and pins every hop.
- **Link/route liveness.** Nothing detects a link going down and reroutes; ZRFC
  6.4 §5.12 requires docks and forwarders to report link and peer state changes
  to the admin service, and §5.11 describes re-heralding a visa onto a new path
  around a failure. Today a topology change revokes affected visas and the flow
  re-requests.
- **Backup links.** `LinkRole::backup` exists in the schema; only `Active` is
  ever sent.
- **Multi-homed nodes**, and equal-cost multipath (ties are broken arbitrarily).
- **`FwdPep.symmetric`** — always `OneWay`.

Also note that ZRFC 6.4 assigns route generation to the **Admin Service**, which
distributes `(egress address, next hop)` routes to docks and forwarders as a
routing table. The implementation folds that role into the visa service and
distributes next hops **per visa** instead. Nodes hold no routing table at all.

and route selection in `zpr-visaservice`, and the consumer in `zpr-core`. See
[REPOSITORIES.md](REPOSITORIES.md).
